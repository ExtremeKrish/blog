# A Shocking Experience

Yo, wassup everyone! As you guys know, I'm on my way to telling life experiences that happened over the two years I was inactive. Here's a story of me experiencing a horrible incident that happened on an unknown date, possibly in August 2023. Here it goes:

### Story

Yo, wassup everyone! I hope you are doing pretty well.

Do you think ghosts or demons exist? If not, then I want to tell you a story when I was in high school. One day, I saw a video that claimed there was a cursed video on YouTube containing words that, if you hear them, something bad will happen.

And as you know, I'm Bear Grylls :D.

I decided to watch the whole video. When the actual sentence began to be said, I quit. I accepted my defeat. I didn't have enough courage to watch that creepy stuff.

But somehow, I got an interesting topic to discuss with my friends, Harsh and Kushal. The next day, they came to my home so we could chill and have some interesting talks.

I told them that I found a cursed video on YouTube. They decided that there was no such thing as a cursed sentence, especially Kushal, who was the bravest person in the whole history, since the ancient and medieval eras. Our god, Almighty Kushal.

He forced me to hear that stuff. Not actually forced, but somehow played it loudly near my ears.

I don't know why, but nothing bad happened to these guys. But after hearing that cursed sentence, I started feeling a unique emotion, a little bit mysterious and thrilled.

Sure, here's the corrected version of the sentence:

After they left, I went to a room in my home.
I put my laptop on the bed and plugged its charger into the board.

Now, the bed was made of iron, which is, of course, a conductor of electricity. And at that time, the floor of the room was bare concrete. Concrete is also somehow a conductor of electricity. It's an insulator only when it's dry, but it was the rainy season, so the floor was moisturized.

So, I plugged in the charger and placed the laptop at the edge of the bed. I dragged a chair and sat cross-legged in it. That was the worst posture, but yeah, that's how I sit.

After 30 minutes of watching 'Black Magic Documentaries' and thinking about that cursed sentence, I decided to unfold my legs because I was bored of sitting cross-legged on that chair. (I was barefooted.)

As soon as I touched my foot on the floor, I got a great shock!

I didn't know what happened. Due to reflex action, I removed my foot from the floor.

Then, just to test out what the hell was happening, I stood up again and got another shock.

At that moment, I realized that I was affected by a cutout in the charger's wire, which was touching the metal frame of the bed. As you know, it was connected with the bare concrete floor, so the current was flowing everywhere, on the floor and on the bed's frame, but not on the bed's mattress or my plastic chair.

So I jumped on the bed and again got a shock from the metallic edge of the bed. Then I jumped off the bed as far as I could.

I ran straight to the kitchen and fainted for a long time.

When I woke up, I wore slippers and went back to that room. I stood on the bed wearing slippers and unplugged the charger. (The switchboard was at a height, but not too high.)

After that creepy incident, I got scared and then listened to 'Hanuman Chalisa' because it is known to be the most divine and sacred hymn of my religion.

Nothing like that ever happened again in my life.

But I still remember that creepy cursed sentence, word for word.

I can't disclose that creepy video or that sentence, but I'm warning you to stay away from being unnecessarily brave.

Because nobody knows what bad can happen to you.

Anyways,

|| GLORY TO HANUMAN ||
